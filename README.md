# File Structure
Under `src/headers`, you can find the implementations for each of the data structures.
Under `tests/`, you can find the test for each implementation.

# Environment
This was built, and tested, on `gcc (GCC) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)` in Fedora 31.
Should not require any special headers.

# Running
To compile, run `make`, and the mrlock and naive implementation tests will be built.
Run either `./naive_test` or `./mrlock_test`.

In the root, you will also find a discussion about our implementation and data structure.
