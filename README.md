# File Structure
Under `src/headers`, you can find the implementations for each of the data structures.
Under `tests/`, you can find the test for each implementation.

# Running
To compile, run `make`, and the mrlock and naive implementation tests will be built.
Run either `./naive_test` or `./mrlock_test`.

In the root, you will also find a discussion about our implementation and data structure.
